# metaheuristics

A Java library vending simple, reusable metaheuristics for optimization.

Currently supported algorithms:

* Genetic Algorithms

Planned algorithms:

* Simulated Annealing (converted from my Clojure implementation)
* Beam Search

## Usage

See "src/samples" for examples using these.

To use with maven locally, checkout out the repo and run `mvn install`.

Alternatively, generate a jar with `mvn package` and find the jar in "target".

TODO Coming soon, maven coordinates.

## TODO

### General

* Simulated Annealing
* Beam Search
* Deploy as jar to maven

### Genetic Algorithms

* Support configurable selection strategies. Aside from culling, there is currently no weighting towards more fit parents.
* A parallel version which can exchange "elite children" across generations. Basically, the concept of cross-pollination.

## Changelog

### 1.0

* Initial release, includes support for genetic algorithms
